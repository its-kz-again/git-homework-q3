git homework
Question 3
--------------
# create new branch and then 3 commit in new branch and push in new branch
# then merge second commit to main branch
# Finally, merge the next commits together.
--------------
# create a new branch
git branch temp
# switch to new branch
git checkout temp
# then 3 commit in new branch and push in new branch
-------------- 
# for merge second commit to main branch
# first use git log and then copy second commit's hash
# and then swith to main branch
git checkout main
git cherry-pick {COMMIT-HASH-HERE}
git push -u origin main
--------------
# next commit is third commit.
# then switch to new branch and get third commit's hash
# solve conflicts
# we repeat the process we said for the second commit for third commit(or all next commits)
